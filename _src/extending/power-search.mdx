By default, your [table](../tutorial/js-table.mdx) has a power search bar. It allows to search through the entire row as a serialized string or through individual columns. Based on the column type, power search provides different search operators for columns. 
For instance, for string values it can check if a string contains a substring or even matches some other string exactly. At the same time, for dates Flipper can filter out records after or before a certain date.
Since Flipper does not have a way of identifying the column type in advance, it always assumes that every column is a string. If you want you can tell Flipper how to handle a column and what power search operators should be available.

You can see a live example of how you can provide the power search config [here](https://fburl.com/code/rrxj86e5). 

You can find the complete list of supported operators [here](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/main/desktop/flipper-plugin/src/ui/data-table/DataTableDefaultPowerSearchOperators.tsx).
